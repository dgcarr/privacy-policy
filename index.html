<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App Name:</strong> OverlandTracker Aus</p>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 28 February 2026</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
OverlandTracker Aus ("the App") is a hiking map application designed to allow users to view their location on a map,
record hiking routes, and attach photos to map waypoints.
</p>

<p>
The App is designed with a privacy-first architecture.
The developer does <strong>not collect, store, transmit, process, or share any personal data</strong>.
All data generated through use of the App remains stored locally on the user's device.
</p>

<h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>
The App does not collect personal information, account data, contact details,
device identifiers, analytics data, or usage metrics.
</p>

<p>
No information is transmitted to the developer or to any third party.
The App operates entirely offline except where internet connectivity is required for map tile retrieval.
</p>

<h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>

<h3>Location Permission</h3>
<p>The App requests access to the device’s location to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the user’s position on the hiking map</li>
<li>Track hiking routes</li>
<li>Associate geographic coordinates with waypoints</li>
</ul>

<p>
Location data is processed exclusively on the device.
It is not transmitted to any external server and is not accessible to the developer.
</p>

<p>
The App does not access location data in the background unless the user explicitly grants background location permission.
Users may revoke location access at any time via device settings.
</p>

<h3>Camera Permission</h3>
<p>The App requests camera access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to capture photos within the App</li>
<li>Attach photos to map waypoints</li>
</ul>

<p>
Photos captured within the App are stored locally on the device.
They are not uploaded, transmitted, backed up by the App, or shared with any third party.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
All application data, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Route history</li>

<li>User settings</li>
</ul>

<p>
is stored locally on the user’s device.
</p>

<p>
The developer has no technical capability to access user data.
If the App is uninstalled, locally stored data may be deleted according to the operating system’s behavior.
</p>

<h2>5. Offline Maps and Map Services</h2>
<p>
The App may use offline map files such as MBTiles stored locally on the device.
If online maps are used, map tile requests may be made directly from the user’s device to the map provider.
Such requests occur independently of the developer and are governed by the map provider’s privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>The App:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not sell personal data</li>
<li>Does not share personal data</li>
<li>Does not use analytics SDKs</li>
<li>Does not use advertising SDKs</li>
<li>Does not use tracking technologies</li>
<li>Does not transmit user data to external servers</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Google Play Data Safety Compliance</h2>

<li>No data is shared with third parties</li>
<li>No data is used for analytics or advertising</li>
<li>Location and camera permissions are used solely for on-device functionality</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
Because no personal data is collected or transmitted, the App is compliant with applicable child privacy regulations.
</p>

<h2>9. Security</h2>

no external data storage systems are used.
Users are responsible for securing their own device and backups.
</p>

<h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
